# Credits Usage

At our service, we use a credit system to power the chatbot functionality. Credits are consumed based on the model type and the number of messages sent. Here's how the credit system works:

## Plans Available

You can choose from 3 different plans in the **Settings** section of your dashboard:

1. **Starter Plan**:  
   - $3 for **100 credits**.  
   - A perfect choice if you're just starting out and want to explore the service.

2. **Smart Plan**:  
   - Auto-renews with a custom amount once your credits hit **0**.  
   - Ideal for users who want an uninterrupted experience and a flexible credit system.

3. **Custom Plan**:  
   - Select a one-time payment of your preferred amount of credits.  
   - Gives you the freedom to choose how much you'd like to pay upfront.

## Credit Consumption

Credits are used as follows:

- **Text Model**:  
  - **1 credit** is used per message.
  
- **Image Model**:  
  - **2 credits** are used per message, even if the message is just text. This ensures you get the full functionality of uploading images to your chatbot.

Keep an eye on your credits to ensure your chatbot remains active and responsive! If you ever need more credits, simply adjust your plan in the dashboard to keep the service running smoothly.
