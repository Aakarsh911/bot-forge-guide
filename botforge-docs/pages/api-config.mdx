# API Config

Our chatbots are designed to integrate seamlessly with APIs to provide dynamic and personalized responses. Here's how the API configuration works:

## Supported Request Type

Currently, our chatbots support only **GET** requests. These requests allow you to fetch data from your APIs using query parameters.

## Query Parameters

You can configure your chatbot to include custom data as query parameters. This makes it easy to create highly interactive and personalized bot experiences.

### Example

Suppose you want your chatbot to fetch product information using an API. You can configure the API URL like this:

```
https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/:barcode
```

In this example:
- **`:barcode`** is a placeholder for a custom parameter.
- The bot will automatically prompt the user to provide the value for `barcode` when needed.

### Bot Interaction

When a user interacts with the bot, it will detect the missing parameter (e.g., `barcode`) and ask the user to provide it. Once provided, the bot will send the GET request and return the API response.

## When Field

The **`when`** field in the API configuration is crucial for determining when the bot should execute the API request. 

- The bot uses this field to understand the context and decides the optimal time to make the API call.
- For example, if you set the `when` field to `user_provides_barcode`, the bot will wait until the user provides the `barcode` before executing the API request.

## Intelligent Execution

Thanks to built-in intelligence, the bot evaluates the `when` field dynamically and ensures that API requests are executed at the right moment, minimizing redundant calls and enhancing user experience.
